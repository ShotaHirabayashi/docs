# Insights Dashboard

You can quickly get a clear understanding of what's happening over time and see the big picture, or get a more granular view for data points like:

* 📈 How many Participant, Recording and Streaming minutes have been used
* 👨‍💻 The number of sessions/meetings happening over time
* 👥 How many participants have joined video calls

In the Rooms Dashboard, you can see a list of all the rooms that currently exist and have been created in your account. Your admins can easily filter the list by searching a room name or choosing a date range to find the insights you’re looking for in seconds.

From the Rooms page you can also access details of all the sessions that have happened within a specific room and quickly filter them by date. This gives you a more detailed view of every session (video call), like what day the session happened, how long it lasted, how many people joined it and how many participant minutes were used.

To access your Insights Dashboard, log in to your Whereby Embedded account and visit the "Insights" section.
