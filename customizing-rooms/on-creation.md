  Some key properties of your rooms should be set when the room is created using
  the API.

# On creation

The roomâ€™s initial **lock state**, the **pattern of the room name** used in the URL and the **room capacity** (maximum number of participants) can all be determined at the time of creation.

Have a look at our [API reference](https://whereby.dev/http-api/) for a complete overview of properties that can be set on room creation.

Further customizations can be done after the room has been created, either by using [URL parameters](using-url-parameters.md) when embedding the room, or by customizing [branding elements](branding-elements.md) like background and logo.
