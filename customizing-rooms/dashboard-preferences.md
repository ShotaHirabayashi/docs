  Some organization preferences can be enabled or disabled from the dashboard,
  eliminating the need for a corresponding URL parameter on every link.

# Dashboard preferences

The feature preferences can be found under "**Configure**” **→** “**Features**”. Any adjustments made here will be applied to all your rooms, unless overridden by specific [URL parameters](using-url-parameters.md) added to the meeting URL.

### Help me fix this

You can add a custom link that appears when users accidentally block their permissions. This can be managed for all meetings via the dashboard, or set for individual meetings via our [URL parameter](using-url-parameters.md#precallpermissionhelplink-less-than-url-greater-than). If you need help building some support documentation we have some [End User Troubleshooting](../faq-and-troubleshooting/end-user-documentation.md) information that may prove helpful!

### Whereby Privacy Policy

From the Features tab, you can choose to remove the mention of Whereby's privacy policy during the pre-call portion. By checking the box you confirm that you have provided our policy by other means. You'll find our policy here:
